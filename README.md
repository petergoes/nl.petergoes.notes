# Notes

These are my personal notes on front-end development. The purpose of this repo / 
website is to give myself a reference to; the things I have learned, quirks I 
come across, anything that helps me building (web) front-end things.

**Please do _not_ mistake this for (official) documentation!** They are my 
_personal_ notes. There is a good chance that the content in this repo/website 
is either; out-of-date, incomplete, incomprehensible, flat-out wrong, 
missspelled or all of the above.

If you do come across mistakes, feel free to submit a PR. I would be grateful.
